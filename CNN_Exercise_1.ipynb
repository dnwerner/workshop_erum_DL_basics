        "Machine learning is a topic that is researched for quite a long time. Biggest problem in the past was the lack of computational ressources. Especially image recognition was terrible in this department, since the analyzation of pictures needed huge feed-forward-networks (bad scaling of parameter numbers).\n",

        "LeNet-5 was one of the earliest convolutional neural networks and promoted the development of deep learning. The main benefit of convolutional networks is their invariance in translation. The other benefit of this approach is the reduction of learnable parameters by introduction of convolutions.\n",

This is because passing all the training data through the network at once is computationally expensive, and it is also more difficult for the network to learn from all the training data at once. The number of samples in a minibatch is called the 'batch size'. The batch size is a hyperparameter that we can tune to make the network learn better. The batch size is usually a power of 2, e.g. 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, etc. to optimally utilize the hardware. In this exercise, we will use a batch size of 64.\n",
